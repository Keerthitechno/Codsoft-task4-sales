Tasks 4 in codsoft for data science

1. Set Up Your Environment
Install Jupyter Lab and necessary Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
2. Load Your Data
Import your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The data can be in formats like CSV, Excel, etc.
3. Data Preprocessing
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle missing data either by filling or dropping.
Convert Categorical Variables: Transform categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection: Identify and select relevant features for the model. This may involve dropping irrelevant columns or creating new features.
4. Split the Data
Divide Data: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance. Typically, the data is split into 80% training and 20% testing.
5. Choose a Model
Select a Model: Choose an appropriate regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Initialize the Model: Set up the model with default or chosen parameters.
6. Train the Model
Fit the Model: Train the model using the training data to learn patterns and relationships.
7. Evaluate the Model
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict values on the testing dataset.
Compute Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.
8. Visualize the Results
Plot Results: Create visualizations to compare actual vs. predicted values. This helps in understanding model performance and identifying any discrepancies.
9. Optimize the Model
Tune Hyperparameters: Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find the best model parameters.
Re-evaluate: Test the optimized model to ensure it performs better than the initial model.
10. Deploy the Model
Save the Model: Store the trained model for future use (e.g., using joblib or pickle).
Load the Model: Reload the model when needed to make predictions on new data.
